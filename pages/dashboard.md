<div class="bg-primary-lighter">
    <h2>To-do for Hero</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Change the background color of the call out box in the hero</li>
        <li>Expand the current box to cover the image? If so, will need to adjust positioning within the box. Otherwise - perhaps give the image a foreground color ;)??</li>
        <li>Change text to proper typography</li>
    </ol>
